Wednesday night found me on a beautiful Colorado reservoir gently paddling on a standup paddle board. The water was calm, the mountains had that perfect evening glow, and I was chatting with a few very talented businesswomen.

I realized something magical was happening as we each shared updates on our businesses.

A sense of clarity, peace, and confidence came over each person as they shared what they were going through and received feedback and encouragement from the group.

* One voiced her plan to raise her rates to industry standards giving her the time back she needs to do her work well and received resounding support and encouragement
* One poised a challenge with the logistics of her packaged service, how to educate her audience, and where to provide the work. We brainstormed and shared our insights and she started to see a strategy to test out her various ideas.
* Another shared how she suddenly found herself with many clients to onboard and how she's in-process to train a manager to give her more time in her business. We sympathized with the sudden onslaught of work (always a good and bad thing!) and applauded her decision to scale up with her team.
* And we all swapped stories about childcare, various creative options, and what we're planning for the fall

This is age-old advice you've heard before but I find we all need reminding over and over...**we do better together**.

Breaking out of our isolation and leaning on our people makes this whole business and family thing somehow more do-able. We may know exactly what we need to do, but it's the reframe in perspective from a friend, or a push in encouragement from a business colleague to make it all actually happen.

Have you been going it alone for too long?
