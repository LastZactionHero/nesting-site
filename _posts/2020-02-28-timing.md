Timing has been a huge theme this week. Probably because I'm counting down the hours(?), days(?), weeks(?) until this kiddo makes his appearance.

You can't help but focus on time. But that's not the only place time has been showing up.

I've received more and more good news and great opportunities in my business in the last month than I have in the last year. Honestly a lot of my goals and visions that I put in place this summer are coming to fruition now, 2.5 weeks before my due date!

It's exciting, but how's that for timing?

An old version of me would have lamented this turn of events. I would have gone with a narrative along the lines of, "You have the worst luck.", "The universe loves to screw with me.", yadda, yadda, yadda.

I don't do that anymore.

Now I laugh.

It is pretty comical and not exactly as I would have liked everything to go down, but I'm thrilled that it's all "going down" at all. And I have given up on trying to control the timing of things.

Everything happens exactly when it needs to happen.

That is timing for you.

We really can't control it.

So here's a small reminder for you this weekend. Trust in the timing of things. Let go your attachment to fulfilling your goals by a certain date or having everything look exactly like you envisioned. What you want, what you desire is coming for you. Trust that! And enjoy the ride. Every twist and turn is there for a reason and it will all make sense when you look back on it.

Now that we've established you can't control time, when do we guess this baby is making his appearance?

I'm thinking gravity will do the trick...next full moon is March 9th!

We shall see.
