__(b) Personal Information__

If you purchase products or services from the site, in addition to the personal information described above, we request payment card information (including card number, expiration address, and verification code).

We do not store your credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for the credit card processor or its collection or use of your information. You may find out more about how Stripe stores and uses your credit card information by accessing its privacy policy on its website. If you choose to use PayPal to make purchases through the site, you will be directed to the PayPal website and provide your payment information directly to PayPal. PayPal’s privacy policy applies to the information you provide on the PayPal website.

We will use your information to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to process and ship an order you place.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. These emails will contain instructions on how to unsubscribe from our email list, or you may contact us through our contact page to request to be removed from our list.

We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs or pixels and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.

Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons.
