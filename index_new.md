        <p class='p2'>When your business is your "only child", it’s easy to sink endless hours into growing your little darling up, but what happens when you’re ready to have a real baby, complete with an adorable, fuzzy head that smells like heaven?</p>

        <p class='p2'>Will you panic?</p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <strong>When pregnancy makes you feel exhausted, sick, or brain-frazzled,</strong> <em>how will you get it all done?</em> <strong>When you take your maternity leave,</strong> <em>will the business run itself?</em> <strong>When you’re ready to get back to work,</strong> <em>how will you manage a baby and your business (when there are still only 24 hours in a day)?</em>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>Enough of the anxiety!</p>

          Running a business is challenging, but finding a way to keep it all going when you’re expecting (and all you’re dreaming about is enjoying your upcoming maternity leave in peace) can feel impossible.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <strong>I know because I remember laying in bed, bulging baby bump and all, crying because I was completely overwhelmed by the thought of making it all work.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          Despite feeling totally stuck, I managed to figure it out. I took my experience in business operations, project planning, and management and cobbled together a plan that gave me time with our son and a business to come back to.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          In hindsight, there were so many things I would have done differently, but I had no roadmap to follow. Being the problem-solving, efficiency-obsessed person that I am, an idea began to form, and instead of returning to business as usual when my leave ended, I decided to pivot.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          I niched my business into consulting and coaching for women who need <strong>help perfecting the imperfect art of being adept, happy, business-owning mothers.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <em>That roadmap I so desperately needed?</em> <strong>I made one and it’s life-altering.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          If you’re struggling to understand what things will look like once your baby arrives, or if you're a work at home mom who feels totally overwhelmed, consider me your new best friend - I’ve figured it out and have the map to prove it.
