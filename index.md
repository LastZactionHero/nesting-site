      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class='p2'>When your business is your "only child", it’s easy to sink endless hours into growing your little darling up, but what happens when you’re ready to have a real baby, complete with an adorable, fuzzy head that smells like heaven?</p>

        <p class='p2'>Will you panic?</p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <strong>When pregnancy makes you feel exhausted, sick, or brain-frazzled,</strong> <em>how will you get it all done?</em> <strong>When you take your maternity leave,</strong> <em>will the business run itself?</em> <strong>When you’re ready to get back to work,</strong> <em>how will you manage a baby and your business (when there are still only 24 hours in a day)?</em>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>Enough of the anxiety!</p>

          Running a business is challenging, but finding a way to keep it all going when you’re expecting (and your body, mind, and spirit just won't stay focused on work) can feel impossible.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <strong>I know because I remember laying in bed, bulging baby bump and all, completely overwhelmed by the thought of making it all work.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
         And I have an extensive background in project management. My job was to take large scale, multi-million dollar projects with 100s of moving pieces, dozens of team members, and several unexpected curveballs from conception to delivery. I should have been the perfect person to design and implement a maternity leave plan.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          But here is the catch and the reason I created this business. This project you're embarking on - planning for maternity leave - requires management of yourself, your pregnant self. There will be unexpected curveballs, new moods and emotions, and moving pieces in a constant state of flux. And even the most experienced project manager will stumble with this personal, highly important endeavor. I'm here to smooth the path for you.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          Despite my own missteps, I pulled together a plan that gave me time with our son and a business to come back to.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          In hindsight, there were so many things I would have done differently, but I had no roadmap to follow. Being the problem-solving, never-settle person that I am, an idea began to form, and instead of returning to business as usual when my leave ended, I directed my focus to a group I hold in the highest esteem, working parents.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          I niched my business into consulting and coaching for women who need <strong>help perfecting the imperfect art of being adept, happy, business-owning mothers.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <em>That roadmap I so desperately needed?</em> <strong>I made one, fully personalized to each individual journey, and it's life-altering.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          If you’re struggling to understand what things will look like once your baby arrives, or if you're a work at home mom who feels totally overwhelmed, I'm here for you - I've taken my background in project and people management and combined it with years of study in empowering women to set up a business that fits their life.
