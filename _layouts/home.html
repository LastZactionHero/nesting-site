          <h3>Did you start your business in order to have more time and flexibility with your future family?</h3>
          <h4>Good for you.</h4>
          
          <p>Whether you’re a designer, copywriter, coach, blogger, in ecommerce or another field...the Internet has allowed moms to rewrite the rules on when, where, and how they work to create a lifestyle that works for them.</p>
          
          <p>You’re a pregnant business owner - Congratulations! First, on your upcoming bundle of joy and Second, on entering this tribe of women changing how we work so we can be there for our kids.</p>
          
          <p>You’re about to use that freedom for the first time to...</p>
          <p>... design a maternity leave that is completely unique to you, your business, and your new family.</p>
          
          <p>You’re not in a corporate job that dictates how much leave you can take and how much you can make while you’re recovering and getting to know your new baby.</p>
          
          <p>You have the freedom to decide exactly what you want to do.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Will you be working at all in the first few weeks or months?</li>
            <li>Will you have a passive product running to bring in some income?</li>
            <li>Will you hire a team to keep the lights on?</li>
            <li>Will you keep your current clients or offboard them?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All this freedom is empowering. It’s also overwhelming.</p>
          <p>Especially for your pregnant body and mind.</p>
          
          <p>I know because I’ve been there.</p>

      <h3>Strategy </h3>
      <p>We’ll start with a Strategy Call. We’ll get to know each other and I’ll learn all about your business and your goals for your maternity leave. We’ll talk about any hang-ups you’ve had with getting work done during pregnancy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define goals for your maternity leave</li>
        <li>Identify options for your business</li>
        <li>Calculate your finances</li>
        <li>Review areas for delegation and automation</li>
        <li>Develop new product ideas</li>
        <li>Discuss productivity and tools to work with the “pregnancy brain”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Plans</h3>
      <p>After the call, I’ll provide you with detailed project plans to accomplish the goals we identify during the strategy session. These plans give you a simple task list to follow on a customized timeline. The timeline ensures the work gets done before D-Day while making sure to build in enough time for your current client work and the Rest that your body needs. </p>
      <p>Project plans may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Build a digital product</li>
        <li>Launch a course</li>
        <li>Create editorial calendars</li>
        <li>Develop marketing content</li>
        <li>Hire and onboard a VA</li>
        <li>Automate a sales funnel</li>
        <li>And more</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>So many business owners keep their business processes in their head. We’re going to take all your important processes and document them using my developed templates. These SOPs (standard operating procedures) can then be used by you when you're pregnant and tired, nursing a newborn and tired, and getting back to work and tired (are you sensing a theme??) OR by any team members you hire making sure the end result is consistent each time.</p>
      <p>Processes may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing, editing, and posting a blog post</li>
        <li>FB group monitoring</li>
        <li>Social media engagement</li>
        <li>Client onboarding</li>
        <li>Funnel design and launch</li>
        <li>SEO optimization</li>
        <li>And more.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h3>Tech & Tools</h3>
      <p>Automation is the savior that allows us to run our businesses in an efficient way making it possible to raise a family and a business at the same time. There are A LOT of software options promising to make your business more efficient, more streamlined, more [insert adjective here]. I have a lot of experience and knowledge of most of these software options.</p>
      <p>Together we will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review your current tools and tech set-up</li>
        <li>Identify new tools to support your business</li>
        <li>Streamline your software mix</li>
        <li>Provide tech support and training for any migrations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Motivation & Support</h3>
      <p>Running an online business is often an isolating affair and I found it to be more so when I was pregnant. Your body and your brain are focused elsewhere. It’s hard to find the dedication for your business when you have such a big non-business event happening in your life. Our Motivation & Accountability calls will help you refocus back on your business Now so you can completely unplug when the little one arrives.</p>
      <p>These calls are used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review plan progress and work through any blocks</li>
        <li>Guide strategic decisions</li>
        <li>Answer questions & brainstorm/refine ideas</li>
        <li>Provide recommended resources for any outsourced work</li>
        <li>Demo tools and tech training</li>
        <li>Commiserate on all the changes your baby is making to your mind and body</li>
        <li>Share tips and tricks for working during this time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the end of our time together your business will be a well-oiled machine. The machine you’ve probably been dreaming about since long before you got pregnant.</p>
      <p>Your body will naturally give you the energy and drive to get your home in order before your baby arrives. This is biology and its honed into each of us. This biological drive ensures we are prepared to bring our baby home, free of distractions, and able to focus on their care. </p>      
      <p>Your business needs the same Nesting efforts that naturally happen in your home. They just may not happen naturally! That’s where I come in. Choose the Package that best fits your business and let’s free you from all of life’s distractions by designing the perfect maternity leave!</p>
