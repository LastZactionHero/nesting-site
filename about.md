          I’m a self-professed get-it-done-never-settle type of gal who makes businesses run better.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          From investment banking and multi-million dollar advertising campaigns to helping online entrepreneurs scale up,
          I live for diving into the backend of a business to design simple, effective strategies and systems while
          shoring up operations for a friction-free ride.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          <strong>It’s pretty straightforward, but…</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p1 text-center'>
          <strong>When you throw a baby into the mix? It’s not so simple.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p1'>
          Many women in business are grappling to find some sort of happy middle ground between being a stay at home
          mom and a thriving business owner.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          Can we hustle less and enjoy more? Can we have a life that includes fulfilling and financially rewarding work, quality time with our family, and space to take care of ourselves?
        </p>

        <p class='p2 text-center'>
          <strong>Can we do all of this while running a business without feeling constantly stressed and perpetually behind?</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2 text-center'>
          <strong>The answer is YES</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          Once I began to see motherhood, not as an obstacle to my professional life, but as a mechanism and
          catalyst for growth, <strong>Nesting Your Business</strong> was officially born.
        </p>

        <p class='p1'>
          I was ready to help other women do what I was successfully doing; expertly running a business at a speed
          and capacity that worked for me while nurturing the family life that I’d always wanted.

        <p class='p2'>
          You’ll still be doing a lot of what you’re already doing, but when you work with me,
          we’ll tweak, refine, implement, and improve.
        </p>

        <p class='p2'>
          Let's:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Take stock of what’s working and what’s not (and clean house as needed)</li>
          <li>Craft strategy that works for you</li>
          <li>Create and implement smart systems to bolster operations</li>
          <li>Adjust expectations and capitalize on this expansive time for work/life alignment</li>
        </ul>

        <p class='p2'>
          Not only do my clients get a savvy and seasoned business developer, but they also get a
          heaping dose of support (from a mom who gets it) to help them through hard times, stuck
          times, or times when it all feels like it’s too much to handle.
        </p>

        <p class='p1 text-center'>
          This is our time to grow.
          <br/>
          As women, mothers, business owners, and humans.
        </p>

        <p class='p2 text-center'>
          It’s our time to flex our intellectual and creative prowess while feeling free to savor
          the sweetness of new life and all of its wonder.
        </p>

        <p class='p2 text-center'>
          <strong>If motherhood is an asset to entrepreneurship shouldn’t we leverage its power?</strong>
        </p>

        <p class='p2 text-center'>
          A thousand times, YES.
