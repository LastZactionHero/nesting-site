  quote: Before I met Meghan at Nesting Your Business I was feeling overwhelmed with
    my business. My systems and organization were sorely lacking. I knew I needed
    to reel back my sanity to carry my business forward in a sustainable way. With
    Meghan’s guidance, I now have a roadmap for the next year that has made my business
    incredibly ordered and streamlined. Meghan’s experience in the corporate world
    means she understands the big picture in a way that positions her to help others
    manage their vision, so they can run their own successful business! She goes above
    and beyond!

  quote: I'd recommend Meghan's services to anyone who is struggling to organize their
    thoughts on the best way to execute a digital plan. I have all these great ideas
    swimming around my head, but I'm so new to digital marketing that I don't always
    know how to implement and I'm easily distracted by cool tools. Meghan is very
    personable and easy to talk to - she's great at simplifying her message so I was
    easily able to understand what she shared. Our talk, and the resulting slides
    and video, have helped me map out exactly what steps to take next. My funnel looks
    to be much less complicated than I originally thought. I'm super grateful for
    the clarity provided!

  quote: "‘Solution oriented’ is the phrase I would use to describe Meghan. I had
    the pleasure of working with Meghan for four years, where we successfully scaled
    operations for an innovative, vendor supported ad product. Under Meghan’s leadership,
    her team delivered quickly and efficiently, becoming a trusted partner to me.
    Meghan is smart and personable; I always enjoyed being able to spend time hashing
    out our business objectives together. Her skills would be valuable to any business."

  quote: I walked into the session with only a general idea of what an opt-in funnel
    was...I knew it was important, but couldn't figure out how to apply it to my business.
    Meghan explained everything perfectly. We jumped right into things, used our time
    wisely, and I got new ideas for services to offer and a realistic/professional
    opt-in idea tailored to fit my specific business model. My services along with
    my opt-in plan are much more cohesive now. And the tools review was greatly appreciated
    to ensure I have a seamless on-boarding process. I'm beyond motivated to get everything
    in place thanks to our time together!

  quote: Meghan was a tremendous resource to me when I was launching a new business.
    She's a wealth of information and well established at helping people like me figure
    out what's next and how to go about it. She's also well connected and gave me
    several leads to get things off the ground. She's organized in her business and
    helped me maneuver what could have been some tricky situations. Meghan saved me
    time and money. Any business would be at an advantage to work with Meghan.
