**7. Payments & Refunds**

Your satisfaction with our products and services is important to us. We invest a great deal of time, research, and care into creating and providing our offerings and materials. Because much of our content is digital, a lenient refund policy could result in the theft of our materials. For this reason, we cannot offer refunds for any of our products such as templates, spreadsheets, and other resources. If you purchase a product and it does not function properly, please reach out to us on our contact page and we will work with you to find a solution. If you enroll in our “Organize the Chaos” online course and are dissatisfied for any reason, you may contact us to request a full refund within 30 days of purchase. Even if your purchase is not eligible for a refund, we welcome your feedback as we are always striving to improve our products and services.

**8. Privacy Policy**

If you purchase products or services from the site, in addition to the personal information described above, we request payment card information (including card number, expiration address, and verification code).

We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site’s services, a cookie enables www.nestingyourbusiness.com to recall previously viewed or entered information on subsequent visits. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.

A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs or pixels and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.

Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons.

**e) Non-Personal Information**

In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We use third parties to help us operate and improve the site. In doing so, we may share with these third parties non-personally identifiable information about users’ use of the site. These third party providers may also use cookies, and you have the ability to control your browser’s cookie settings, as discussed above. We use third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to provide us with general demographic and interest-level information about our users and to help create a better user experience. We do not control information collected by third parties and are not responsible for their use of that information.

**f) Release of Information**

If www.nestingyourbusiness.com is ever sold, the information we have obtained from you through your voluntary participation in our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our website of that change in control and practices, and we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests you might make of us.

**g) How You Can Correct or Remove Information**

We provide this privacy policy as a statement to you of our commitment to protect your personal information.

**9. Choice of Law & Dispute Resolution**

These terms of use and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado.  If you experience a problem with the site, or believe you have a cause of action against Nesting Your Business, please contact us, and we will work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. Should our good faith efforts fail to result in a resolution, you agree that, as a final means of settling any dispute arising under these terms, the Parties shall submit to binding arbitration conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) for commercial arbitration with hearings to be conducted in Boulder or Denver Colorado, before one Arbitrator, who need not be selected from the roster of the AAA. The proceedings may be conducted by teleconference for the convenience of any Party, and the findings of the arbitrator shall be binding, final and enforceable on the Parties and such findings may be reduced to judgment in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  Nothing in this paragraph prevents Nesting Your Business from seeking injunctive relief in a court of law to protect its intellectual property rights and prevent irreparable harm. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding under this paragraph shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs. Any cause of action you have arising out of use of this site must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.  If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms of use to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of these terms of use, and the remainder of the terms of use shall continue in full force and effect.  A printed version of these terms of use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.
