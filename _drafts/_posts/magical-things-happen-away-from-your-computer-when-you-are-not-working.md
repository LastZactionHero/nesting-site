Today I was presented with one of those logistical puzzles that comes from working with a baby at home. We needed to be out of the house during morning nap time. And I had a blog post to write. 

Prior to the 6 month mark, I had a strategy for this situation. Go through the whole nap time routine - milk, diaper change, read a book, and then into the car seat. B would usually fall asleep during the 10 minute drive to the coffee shop. And if he didn't, a quick walk around the block would do the trick. We have this great car seat stroller system, so I would just pop him out of the car, into the stroller, put up the shade, and I could usually get 2-3 hours of work done. B actually slept better and longer in coffee shops. It must have been just the perfect amount of background din. His own live sound machine and it got Mom out of the house too. Such a win win!
