Perfect.

We all want to do things _perfectly_. Sure, we give lip service to "shipping at 80%", done-is-better-than-perfect, and MVPs (minimum viable products), but secretly - or not so secretly - we still want our stuff to be perfect.

**Here's the really good thing --**

It's never going to be perfect.

To get to perfect, you have to devote your ENTIRE LIFE to your work. And you, my friend, have a great, big life outside of your work.

You don't want to work 80 hour weeks, you don't want to sacrifice your sleep and health to make your business work, you don't want to be frazzled and stressed with one eye constantly looking elsewhere (on work when you're with your kids and on your kids when you're working).

So we have to give up Perfect.

For real, this time.

You know my work's mission is setting up your business so you have the time and energy for everything that's important in your world.

For over a year, I've been working 1:1 with moms. I've taken them through a framework to explore and improve every area of their business and mental game so they can live the life they've always envisioned - fulfilling and financially rewarding work, quality time with their family, and space to take care of themselves.

I've loved every minute of it. Everything I'm learning, I'm passing on to these women. And through this work, we're building businesses that are strong, sustainable, and designed to support what we want for ourselves, our families, and our workdays.

Perfect? No.

But perfect for each person? Yes, absolutely!
