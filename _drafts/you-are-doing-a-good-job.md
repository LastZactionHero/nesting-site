We woke up this morning and the heat wasn't working. It's been off and on for the last few weeks. Luckily a quick flip of the switch kicked it back on. Getting in the car today, I got a phone call that the childcare room at daycare needed a thorough cleaning and wouldn't be open in the morning. After I got Bennet in his car seat, my phone fell out of the car and the screen cracked. On top of all of this, our retreat starts tonight and I had a big day planned with final preparations.

Mercury retrograde? Just a standard day in mom life?

Whatever you want to call it. These sorts of days happen. And I know a lot of people that couldn't handle it. I've had old bosses that would have cracked after just one of these events, let alone all 3 on a big day.

This is one of those positives to being a mom in business. We don't get as flustered. Or even if we do on the inside and want to yell, scream, or curl into a ball - we don't have that luxury. There's people that depend on us. Little people that wouldn't understand our meltdown. (ok, yes, I know the meltdowns do happen, but most days I know you go with the flow.) And that's something to be seriously applauded.

It's easy to think this is just life. Nothing special. We're just doing what's required. But you should know there's a lot of high-powered leaders that don't do this nearly as well as you.

You are doing a good job.

I hope you hear that on a regular basis. (I have a sneaky suspicion that you don't.) That doesn't make it any less true.

Cheers to you momma.
